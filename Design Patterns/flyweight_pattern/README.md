# Flyweight Pattern

## Overview

The Flyweight Pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing common object instances instead of creating new ones.

## Key Points

- Useful for handling a large number of similar objects.
- Uses intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (unique) states.

## Example Use Cases

- Text editors (character objects sharing fonts and styles).
- Game development (storing reusable sprites).
