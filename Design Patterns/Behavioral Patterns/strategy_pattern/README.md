# Strategy Pattern

## Overview

The Strategy Pattern allows defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.

## Key Points

- Promotes the Open-Closed Principle.
- Avoids conditional statements by encapsulating behaviors.

## Example Use Cases

- Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.).
- Payment processing (Credit Card, PayPal, Bitcoin).
