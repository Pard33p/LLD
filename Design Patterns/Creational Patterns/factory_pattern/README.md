# Factory Method Pattern

## Overview

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Key Points

- Encapsulates object creation logic.
- Promotes loose coupling by delegating instantiation to subclasses.

## Example Use Cases

- Logging frameworks.
- Document processing applications.
